Make a class to display yourself in this community mod!
<br>
Ran by Alzarath's AFCompiler! Make sure to thank him!

## How to join?
It's quite simple!
1. Make a class in this format: 
> A spell - Q spell - W spell - E spell - R spell - Class description passive
2. Send the file over to Fishhatter or JTRNB to get your class added in!
> Send to cookies, since he has the current mod file up to date.
3. Limit 1 class per person, so design wisely!
4. You may make changes to your class at any time (just send the file!)

## Github Info
Once in a while, the github will be updated with the newest classes and changes.

**mod_output.json** is the mod file you need in order to create a party on Acolytefight.
Enter the file into Load File on the Modding page.
